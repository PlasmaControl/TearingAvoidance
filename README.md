# Tearing Avoidance Control
- Tearing mode instability is the leading cause of plasma disruption in a tokamak.
- This repository provides the Python scripts for training the ML models:\
  (1) Tearing mode prediction model using deep learning\
  (2) Tearing mode avoidance model using deep reinforcement learning

# Note
- Some scripts need experimental data from DIII-D, which are not available from this repository.   To access DIII-D data, you should become a DIII-D user, per the instructions at https://d3dfusion.org/become-a-user/ .
