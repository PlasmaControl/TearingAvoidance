# Tearing Avoidance Control
- Tearing mode instability is the leading cause of plasma disruption in a tokamak.
- This repository provides the Python scripts for training the ML models:\
  (1) Tearing mode prediction model using deep learning\
  (2) Tearing mode avoidance model using deep reinforcement learning

# Note
- Some scripts need experimental data from DIII-D, which are not available from this repository. The data usage needs a [policy agreement from DIII-D](https://diii-d.gat.com/ssl_form/cyberaccess/DIII-D_Data_Usage_Policy.pdf).
